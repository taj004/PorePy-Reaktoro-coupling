# PorePy-Reaktoro-coupling

This repostory contain the run scripts for the paper "A discrete fracture matrix framework for simulating single-phase flow and non-isothermal reactive transport". The implementation is by Shin Irgens Banshoya, Dept. of Mathematics, UiB.

The implementation uses the banch ´modified_discretization_matrices' of PorePy. The easiest way to install this branch is to follow the PorePy installation instructions, but replace the line `git checkout main` to `git checkout modified_discretization_matrices`. Also version 2.8.0 of Reaktoro is used.

Please be aware that the simulations in § 4.3 and 4.4 will take some time run. Running these cases on your own computer is at our own risk.
